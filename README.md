## Front End Interview Challenge
## Set-up
Clone the repo locally. Inside the REPO there are 2 folders the src folder containing the frontend code. And the serve folder containing the code for the graph QL server.
To run the frontend run **_npm install_** followed by **_npm run dev_** in the root folder.

To run the server run _**node server.js**_ in the server directory.


## Improvements
Due to time constraints I was not able to add the following improvements

- More tests
- Button component
- Grid component
 - Additional details
 - Additional images
- Seperate calls for both the launches list and the selected launch
